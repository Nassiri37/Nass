Scooter / Bicycle / Boat Rental with multiple location configuration

This is my first ever script so if the code is a bit wonky go easy on me!

I was looking for something similar to this but just couldnt find anything 
All this is a free basic and open source bike / scooter / boat rental script that allows for multiple locations and to return the bike/scooter/boats!  

I couldnt find the scooter model creator if any knows please add a PR so I can credit them!
